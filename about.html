        <div class="item item-2">Hello! My name is Leigh Kowalchuk. I was born and raised in Lethbridge, Alberta and I currently reside in Victoria, British Columbia, where I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Victoria. A little bit about me: I've been a huge fan of video games my entire life. I have a keen interest in console, PC, and mobile games, and I collect older generation games and consoles. My passion spans a wide range of genres and platforms; however, I hold many Nintendo franchises close to my heart, such as Mario, Pok√©mon, and Animal Crossing, along with the entire Sims and Rock Band franchises.

            In addition to gaming, I've been creating art for as long as I can remember. I have experience in various mediums, including painting, drawing, sculpting, and, more recently, digital 3D modeling. I've also played competitive softball for numerous teams across Alberta and recently claimed the title of Provincial Champion in my last season.
            
            Looking ahead, my biggest life goal is to combine my creative skills and passion for video games by pursuing a career in the realm of game development. I find immense excitement in the thought of being able to contribute to the ever-evolving world of gaming.
