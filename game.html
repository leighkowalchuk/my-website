        This is documentation of my game that I am currently working on. The inspiration for this game comes from 
        my strong passion for video games and art. With this untitled video game, I intend to build an immersive 
        world with a memorable storyline as the player navigates the different world areas. Throughout the story, 
        the player will be able to interact with various items to trigger cutscenes that are unique to the player's 
        choices. I am currently working on creating new assets and buildling the character dialog mechanics

        <div class="item item-2">This is my first asset for my video game that I created in Blender. I knew that 
            in order to get the environment I desired for my video game, I had to create the assets myself. This 
            led me to learn Blender without any previous knowledge of 3D modeling software. I used tools such as 
            YouTube, Reddit, and Patreon to learn the basics of 3D modeling and texturing.

        <div class="item item-3">This is the main character in my game that I modeled and rigged in Blender. This 
            was the biggest obstacle I have faced thus far in this project, as I struggled to resolve the specific 
            weight painting issues that I encountered. With the help of the online 3D modeling community, I was 
            able to resolve this issue as well as gain knowledge to avoid similar issues in the future.

            able to integrate my existing coding knowledge to implement player mechanics. This aspect of the game took
            a lot of tweaking in order to acheive the exact player speed, rotation and animation alignment that I 
            desired
